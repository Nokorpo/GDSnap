# GDSnap

This is a screenshot testing/snapshot testing library for Godot. Still in development.

> **WARNING:** This is still very early in development. The API _will_ change in the future.

Current features:
* Creates folder structure to store base/new screenshots. They are properly ignored by git and the Godot editor.
* Run to generate the base screenshots.
* Run to compare screenshots.
* Multithreading for comparing large screenshots.
